<br> I am a researcher who recently completed my doctoral research at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. My research is in the area of quantum error correction codes. More specifically, my work focuses on reducing the communication cost for secret recovery in quantum secret sharing schemes. In the past, I also worked on problems in compressed sensing, image processing and distributed storage codes. I will begin my work as a postdoctoral research fellow this November. I am currently looking for a short-term research/programming/teaching job suited to my skill set.
