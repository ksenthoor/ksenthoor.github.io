<br> I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Delft University of Technology working on quantum network applications. I recently received my Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, with my thesis on communication efficient quantum secret sharing schemes. In the past, I also worked on problems in compressed sensing, image processing and distributed storage codes.
