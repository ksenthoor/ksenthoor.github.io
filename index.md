<br> I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Delft University of Technology working on quantum network applications. I recently received my Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. My doctoral research focused on how to reduce the communication cost during secret recovery in quantum secret sharing schemes. In the past, I also worked on problems in distributed storage, image processing and compressed sensing. My areas of research interest include error correction codes, information theory and signal processing.
