<br> I am a postdoctoral researcher in  [Prof. Stephanie Wehner](https://qutech.nl/person/stephanie-wehner/)'s lab at QuTech in the Delft University of Technology. My current research work is on the topic of quantum network applications. I recently received my Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. My doctoral research focused on how to reduce the communication cost during secret recovery in quantum secret sharing schemes. My areas of interest also include error correction codes, information theory, distributed storage and signal processing.
