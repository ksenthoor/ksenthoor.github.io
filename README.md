I am a PhD scholar at Indian Institute of Technology Madras working under the supervision of Prof. Pradeep Sarvepalli.

I currently work in the area of quantum error-correcting codes. My areas of interest also include classical error-correcting codes, information theory, distributed storage and signal processing.
